TO DO ASSIGNMENT 3

- Gather images and text about your candy. Please do not use filler text for
the content of the web page.
- The layout for the page should be created using a liquid approach. This
does not mean that the layout needs to be full-width but if the page is not
full-width the contents of the page should be aligned to the center of the
browser.
- Use a custom font that would be appropriate for the type of content that
will be on the webpage.
- gradient background
- hover effect(s)
- svg ?
- Create a footer that contains a logo, company information, and a quick
contact form (just the front end, the form does not need to work!)

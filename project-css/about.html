                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>For a quarter of a century, we have shared the joy of Jellycat toys with people 
                    of all ages, across the globe. Over this time, our unmistakable characters have 
                    gained the affection of millions – and center stage in many of the most prestigious 
                    stores across 77 countries.</p>
                <p>Our designers play until something magical and unexpected happens – 
                    and a new character is born! We source beautiful materials that 
                    are noticeably softer, subtler and long-lasting.</p>

                    <h2>History of Jellycat</h2>
                    <p>Jellycat was founded in the UK in 1999 by the Gatacre brothers, William and Thomas.
                        The goal of Jellycat is to create simple, yet innovative soft toys with a distinctive charm.
                        The brand quickly earned success from their products with its dedication to creating detailed, 
                        soft and adorable plush toys. Jellycat has a large and diverse cast of characters with lots of
                        personality infused into each toy.</p>
                    <p>For over 25 years, Jellycat has continued to expand its collection of soft toys, 
                        introducing new characters and innovative designs. 
                        Today, Jellycat stands as a symbol of creativity, comfort and playfulness.
